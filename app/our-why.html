           Empowering local farmers in Myanmar to stop growing opium and producing methamphetamine while still earning a
           consistent income. After a wave of US sanctions, a crumbling banking system with curtailed access to harvest-dependent
           agriculture loans, the global pandemic, and a tumultuous military coup, these farmers had no other choice than to
           support illicit drug production.

         <p class="history__text">
          Given that Myanmar is the second largest opium-producing country with 90% of all production coming from the Shan State,
          Morning Rocket had a clear starting point. On top of that, our founder recognized the importance of addressing the
          methamphetamine problem too, as Myanmar is the top-producing country globally. From there, he began meeting with local
          farmers, touring milling plants, and coordinating with exporters. The goal was originally to sell coffee to Australian
          roasteries.

       <p class="history__text">
        Ethical sourcing methods were an <span>afterthought</span> for these roasteries. Instead, the primary focus was getting the highest
        quantity of premium coffee for the lowest price. Although Myanmar coffee is a step above local competing markets in
        Brazil, Colombia, Thailand, Laos, and beyond, its <span>lower production quantity</span> per acre simply couldn’t compete with
        large-scale producers. Despite the setback, our founder was inspired to put Myanmar’s coffee market on the map.
